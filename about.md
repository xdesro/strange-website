# about

hi i’m [henry](https://henry.codes), i’m a creative web developer based in ~~new york city~~ denver, colorado.

welcome to my website. i don’t have a very good reason for making this site other than that i thought it would be fun :)

’twere i to pontificate a bit — and if you know me, you know i usually ’twere — i’ve been thinking a lot lately about digital legacy, the sorts of things that ought to be online, where they ought to live, etc.

much of my writing, good or not _(mostly not)_, lives on twitter, which feels very centralized and temporal. in creating this site _(as well as [stillness.digital](https://stillness.digital))_, i hope to achieve two goals; giving the stupid shit i write a more permanent home, and putting more weird code online.

## colophon

<sup>1</sup> this site is built with Eleventy and Sass, and uses ~~no JavaScript~~ a very small amount of JavaScript for the House of Leaves post.

<sup>2</sup> if you like this style of website, check out jordan’s [css framework for making more websites like this](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/). i didn’t use it here, but gosh i sure wish i had discovered it a little earlier in the process lol.

<sup>3</sup> the primary font on this website is [redaction](https://www.redaction.us/).

<sup>4</sup> i appreciate you reading all of this, so i wanted to tell u that most of the other folks that come to this website think you’re cute _(but they’re too shy to tell you!)_. have a great day on the Internet.
